ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest project: a Stopwatch Timer application! ðŸ•’
I'm thrilled to announce the launch of my Stopwatch Timer application, built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was a great opportunity to hone my coding skills and create something practical and useful.
ðŸ”¹ Features:
Start, stop, and reset functionality
Lap feature to record multiple lap times
Stylish design with a retro feel
Easy to use and intuitive interface
ðŸ‘‰ Check it out here: 
I'm particularly proud of the lap feature, which allows users to record up to 4 laps before automatically stopping the stopwatch. It's perfect for timing workouts, races, or any other time-sensitive activities.
I want to give a big shoutout to Prodigy Infotech for their constant support and inspiration throughout this project. ðŸŒŸ
